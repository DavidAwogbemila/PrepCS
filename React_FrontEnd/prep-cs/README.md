Notes about development:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Much of the authorization and authentication implementation was done following [rwieruch's](https://www.robinwieruch.de/about/) post [here](https://www.robinwieruch.de/complete-firebase-authentication-react-tutorial/).
